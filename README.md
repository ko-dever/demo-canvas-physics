# What is this repository ?

This repository is just a technical demonstration involving a canvas, balls, and some physics.

To see it online, check out the domain in the file `package.json`.


# Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.


# How to run the project

1. Create a local copy of the repo on your computer.

    You can clone the repo with `git`.

    Or you can [download it](../../downloads/) and extract the ZIP file.


2. In your terminal, enter the directory created at the previous step :

    `cd <project_folder>`


3. Install the dependencies :

    `npm install`


4. Then start the project (two ways to do this) :

    #### By running the local development server

    Type this command in your terminal : `npm run dev`

    The project should automatically be opened in your default browser.

    If not, find the URL to open by looking at your terminal.


    #### Or by creating a local build

    Type this command in your terminal : `npm run build:local`

    And then open the file `<project_folder>/dist/index.html` in your browser.
